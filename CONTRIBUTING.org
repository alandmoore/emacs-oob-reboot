#+TITLE: Contributing

/This is just a first draft, feel free to complete and/or modify it./

** Pull Requests

One concern at a time per request. This makes it easier to discuss it in
the comments.

** Issues

Create an issue instead of a pull request when you either don't have any patch
to offer or the proposed change seems at least a little dubious.

** Coding Guidelines

- Read http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html.
- Yes it is 2017, yes we all have 30'' monitors, but please avoid very long
  lines in the code you push.
- No leading whitespaces.
- No trailing whitespaces.
- When the code doesn't speak for itself, comment it.
